ExposureCheck:

This DCTL was created to be a monitoring tool. Place it before starting to develop your look, and you will see your color adjustments affecting the curve and the middle gray. The DCTL creates a grayscale ramp, exposure chart, and middle gray overlay on the image; you can adjust the size of the charts as you wish. It was designed to be used in the DaVinci Wide Gamut color space, but it can be adaptable by entering the numerical values of middle gray.

DWG_MATRIX_REMOVE_ADD:

This DCTL file offers the option to use either Arri Matrix Remove or Arri Matrix Add with DaVinci Wide Gamut Input. 

Linear2DWG:

This DCTL transforms to linear gamma to correct exposure. Input color space: DWG.
